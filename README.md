Each book is stored in its own folder. For example, the `CleanCode` folder contains:

- `README.md` — A summary and overview of the book.
- One subfolder per chapter (`Chapter01`, `Chapter02`, etc.).
- Each chapter folder contains:
  - A C# project file (`.csproj`) which groups all exercises for that chapter.
  - Exercise source files (`.cs`) implementing the solutions.
  - An optional `notes.md` file for chapter-specific observations, key concepts, or tips.
- A `notes.md` at the book root can hold general thoughts, overall progress, or additional remarks.
